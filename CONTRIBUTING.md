# But what if i don't know how to add cards :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add the your own card!

Code - 

               <!-- card end-->
               <div class="card"
                  style="width: 17rem; margin:20px;border-radius: 10%;box-shadow: 2px 2PX 15PX 15PX rgb(104, 102, 102);">
                  <img src="images/Apoorv.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
                  <div class="card-body">
                     <h5 class="card-title">Apoorv Maheshwari</h5>
                     <p class="card-text">Hello, I am a passionate Application Developer (Android/iOS) working as Lead Coordinator in Blockchain Research Lab</p>
                     <a href="https://github.com/Apoorv-cloud" class="btn btn-primary"> Github</a>
                     <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/apoorv-maheshwari-6689791aa/" class="btn btn-primary">Linkdin</a>
                  </div>
               </div>
           <!--card end-->

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Try and test it on your own system and then create a Pull request. You can adjust height of image of character so that it will fit in card.
